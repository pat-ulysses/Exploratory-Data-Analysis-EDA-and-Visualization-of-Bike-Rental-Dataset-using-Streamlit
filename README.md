This Project was created as a final project for an online course. The aim of this project is to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and create a interactive visualization on a bike rental dataset using Python and Streamlit. It aims to uncover trends, patterns, and insights related to bike rental behavior across different time frames and weather conditions. The app provides an intuitive interface for users to explore the data dynamically. As a part of the project we were tasked with creating 4 core business questions and answering those questions using EDA and visualizations.
